    "- **Standard Deviation (std)**: The age values have a standard deviation of 15.81. This means the ages are somewhat spread out from the mean.\n",
    "- **Min**: The minimum age is 25.\n",
    "- **25% (1st Quartile)**: 36.25 is the age below which 25% of the data falls.\n",
    "- **50% (Median)**: 47.5 is the middle value (median) for age, meaning half the values are below this and half are above.\n",

    "- **Standard Deviation (std)**: The ratings have a standard deviation of 2.05, indicating a moderate spread around the mean.\n",
    "- **Min**: The lowest rating is 4.5.\n",
    "- **25% (1st Quartile)**: 5.85 is the rating below which 25% of the data falls.\n",

    "- **Max**: The highest rating is 8.9.\n",

    "- **Age**: Ages are moderately spread with a mean age of 45, and the values range from 25 to 60.\n",
